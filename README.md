# The Whereabouts of The Missing ***** #
## Project Description ##
Have you ever lost a piece of your favorite clothing in NYUAD laundry rooms? 

It could be your favorite cozy sweatshirt, soft pair of socks, or sometimes... your freshly bought underwear...?

This project sheds light on the laundry theft incidents on campus through a fictional story revolving around three characters: victim, suspect, and a clueless cat lover who accidently became a part of the wrong interview. Interestingly, the audience never gets to know what actually happened in the laundry room; they only have to guess the story based on two completely different point of views. Did Chad really steal Mariette's underwear? Or maybe is Mariette accusing an innocent person and ruining his social reputation? 


## Process ##
### Phase 1: Script ###
After we settled with the idea of laundry theft incident and the interview format, Rasa and I worked on the script. We wrote one long script that include all characters' lines and their order as they will be edited in the video and three sub-scripts for each character. Making sub-scripts were helpful as each character's interview was shot separately.

### Phase 2: Filming and Editing ### 
I was in charge of filming and editing the video. Our project was filmed with BlackaMagic Poket Camera with 12-35mm lens. The sound was separately recorded with my iPhone voice recorder which did a fairly good job of capturing clear sounds. The footages were editted with Davinci Resolve. 

We invited two students from outside to act as Mariette and Chad. Rasa showed a wonderful acting as Maddie, a clueless cat lover. Each character's interview was filmed seperatedly and later edited as one video. To create a tension between the lines of Mariette and Chad, I filmed two characters with opposite frame compositions; Mariette is filmed from her right and Chad is filmed from his left. For Maddie, I tried filming from diverse angles to differentiate her from the tension between Mariette and Chad. 


### Phase 3: Website ###
Douglas and Zaid worked on the website while video was being produced. One of the features that I like about the website is the video of laundry machine playing in the background. It reflects the chaotic nature of the conversation and how this kind of incident repeatedly happens on NYUAD campus. Rasa worked on the character descriptions and photos for the website. 

## Reflection and Evaluation ##
I think most of our goals were met with the final website. I love the final outcome of the project and I really enjoyed working with my teammates. They trusted me in terms of filming and editing which gave me lost of room to be creative and try different things. I was only able to do this because I also trusted my teammates in terms of building the website. We constantly communicated and updated each other on the progress we made every couple days to make sure we are all on the same page.
